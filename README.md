## Number Guesser Comp Pair Project
This was the first pair project we had at Turing. The project was to make an interactive guessing game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There were three phases of the project that could be completed, each increasing in difficulty. The basic point of the game is for the computer to generate a random number and the user to put in two numbers to create a number range and then input their names and their number guesses. It's actually a fun game! 

In the beginning, my partner and I were VERY unfamiliar with JavaScript and so we thought we would be happy to complete and understand phase one. However, even with our late start to working on JavaScript, we got almost all the way through phase two! 


I don't want to speak for my partner, but I think we would both agree this had quite a large learning curve. It was even a learning curve to use git and share responsibilities. We had to learn to work together and I think we learned a lot.
